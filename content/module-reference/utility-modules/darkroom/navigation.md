Zoom and pan the current image.

The navigation panel (displayed on the top left hand side of the darkroom) shows a full preview of the current image with a rectangle showing the area that is currently visible in the central panel. You can interact with this module using your mouse in the same way as you can interact with the main image (scroll to zoom in/out, middle-click to cycle through zoom levels, click+drag to pan). Alternatively, the current zoom scale is displayed in a combobox to the bottom-right of the preview -- click to choose from a number of common zoom levels or type a number to set the zoom level manually.

The navigation panel can be toggled on/off with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+N by default).
