Create a softened image using the [Orton effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orton_(photography)).

Michael Orton achieved his results on slide film by using two exposures of the same scene, one well exposed and one overexposed. He then used a darkroom technique to blend these two images into a final image where the overexposed image was blurred.

This module is a near-copy of Orton's analog process into the digital domain.

# module controls

size
: The size of blur of the overexposed image. The bigger the size, the softer the result.

saturation
: The saturation of the overexposed image.

brightness
: The brightness (EV) of the overexposed image.

mix
: How the two images are mixed. 50% represents an equal mix of the well exposed and overexposed images.
