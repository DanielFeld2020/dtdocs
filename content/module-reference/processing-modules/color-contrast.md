A simplified control for changing the contrast or separation of colors between the green/magenta and blue/yellow axes in Lab color space. Higher values increase color contrast, lower values decrease it.

# module controls

green-magenta contrast
: Change the green-magenta color contrast. This is equivalent to raising or lowering the steepness of the a\* curve in Lab. Lower values desaturate greens and magenta, while higher values increase their saturation.

blue-yellow contrast
: Change the blue-yellow color contrast. This is equivalent to raising or lowering the steepness of the b\* curve in Lab. Lower values desaturate blues and yellows, while higher values increase their saturation.
